# I DO NOT SUPPORT ANY HACKING!
even though this repo might be a hacker repo, IT IS NOT! you will get banned if you use this as THIS IS A DETECTABLE SCRIPT! if you are banned, it was your problem to exploit with it.

# What are these scripts for?
for beginners at studio wanting to make simple games, as these scripts are a bit buggy and let beginners debug using semi-readable code, these scripts might include test scripts like the first version of hoverboard which is really buggy, credita to the dev forum and the assistant for helping me debug code

in StarterPlayer then StarterCharacterScripts
